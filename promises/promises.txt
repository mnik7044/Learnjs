Promise is a promise of code execution promise either fullfills or not in both case the user is informed.
Promise is the solution of callback hell.

Promise ya to resolve hota hai ya to reject hota hai.

Syntax of promise is 
let promise = new promise(function(resolve,reject){
    
})


Promise ko use karne ke liye kuch methods hote hai
They are:

then()-- Used with callback when the promise is successfully resolved or fullfilled
catch()-- It is used with callback when your promise is rejected or if an error occurs
finally()-- Used when the promised is either resolved sucvcesfully or rejected succesfully/Mtlb ye farak nahi padta ki resolve hua ya reject hua hai finally har case nme chalega


Promise do step me hota hai pehle usko create karna hota hai then usko use krna hota hai
